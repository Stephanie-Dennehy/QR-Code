## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had a hard time getting the corners of the image to round initially. I had to work through some trial and error with my CSS to get it to show up correctly. I realized that I had to remove the padding from the image to get that to show up the way I intended. 


### Continued development

I plan to continue complting challenges to improve my HTML and CSS skills as well as adding in some Javascript.
